# MyLinuxEssentials
Everything I put on every install. My alternatives to mainstream products. 

# Everyday Carry
* Lenovo ThinkPad X1EG2
* Librem 5

# Distro
Right now I'm using [PopOS](https://pop.system76.com/) on my ThinkPad X1EG2 and Ubuntu 20.04 on my desktop. I highly recommend popOS for it's power settings and Ubuntu Base. I will probably end up moving to Debian or Fedora in the future.

# Theming / Desktop Customization
* [Mojave Gtk Theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Mojave-gtk-theme) - I was a mac nerd before I realized I was a linux nerd. This theme is pretty slick and is just the right amount of mac for me. 
* [Dash to Dock](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/) - Mac-like application launcher for Gnome. 

# Utilities
* [Standard Note](https://standardnotes.org/) - I use this encrypted note taking service
as a replacement for evernote. yes I purchased the 5 year sub, best decision ever.
* [Hyperspace](https://hyperspace.marquiskurt.net/releases/desktop.html) - My Mastodon client of choice.

# Developer
* [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) - My Git Client of choice.
* Visual Studio Code - I mean, Duh.
* [VMware Workstation Pro](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro.html) - I highly recommend the investment. I am so much more productive in here than I am in Virtual box. plus it's easier to take projects to work.
